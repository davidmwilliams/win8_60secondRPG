# win8_60secondRPG
This is a simple text-based game I wrote in 2013 for the Windows 8 store, when Windows 8 first became a thing. I wrote it simply to teach myself how to publish for the store.

It's a pretty basic C# game with some RPG elements involved, and a little bit of ASCII art.

The game asks if you want to go left, right, or straight ahead but actually it doesn't matter; each room you move to is simply randomly selected. There's no map, you merely wander around and fight monsters.

Like the title says, it is a 60 second game and simply an idle bit of fun. Still, maybe it could be expanded to make a bigger RPG game with a real map and a store, quests, etc.

You can find it on the Windows store here - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/60s-rpg/9nblggh0dgds?activetab=pivot:overviewtab
